</dd>
<dt><em>Abstract:</em>  
<dd>

The Unpublished Digital Geohazards Map of Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and Vicinity, California is composed of GIS data layers and GIS tables in a 10.1 file geodatabase (samo_geohazards.gdb), a 10.1 ArcMap (.MXD) map document (samo_geohazards.mxd), individual 10.1 layer (.LYR) files for each GIS data layer, an ancillary map information (.PDF) document (samo_geology.pdf) which contains source map unit descriptions, as well as other source map text, figures and tables, metadata in FGDC text (.TXT) and FAQ (.HTML) formats, and a GIS readme file (samo_gis_readme.pdf).  Please read the samo_gis_readme.pdf for information pertaining to the proper extraction of the file geodatabase and other map files.  To request GIS data in ESRI 10.1 shapefile format contact Stephanie O’Meara (stephanie.omeara@colostate.edu; see contact information below).  The data is also available as a 2.2 KMZ/KML file for use in Google Earth, however, this format version of the map is limited in data layers presented and in access to GRI ancillary table information.  Google Earth software is available for free at: <A HREF="http://www.google.com/earth/index.html">&lt;http://www.google.com/earth/index.html&gt;</A>.  Users are encouraged to only use the Google Earth data for basic visualization, and to use the GIS data for any type of data analysis or investigation.  The data were completed as a component of the Geologic Resources Inventory (GRI) program, a National Park Service (NPS) Inventory and Monitoring (I&amp;M) Division funded program that is administered by the NPS Geologic Resources Division (GRD).  Source geologic maps and data used to complete this GRI digital dataset were provided by the following: California Geological Survey.  Detailed information concerning the sources used and their contribution the GRI product are listed in the Source Citation section(s) of this metadata record (samo_geohazards_metadata_faq.html; available at <A HREF="http://nrdata.nps.gov/geology/gri_data/gis/samo/samo_geohazards_metadata_faq.html">&lt;http://nrdata.nps.gov/geology/gri_data/gis/samo/samo_geohazards_metadata_faq.html&gt;</A>).  Users of this data are cautioned about the locational accuracy of features within this dataset.  Based on the source map scale of 1:24,000 and United States National Map Accuracy Standards features are within (horizontally) 12.2 meters or 40 feet of their actual location as presented by this dataset.  Users of this data should thus not assume the location of features is exactly where they are portrayed in ArcGIS or other software used to display this dataset.

(available at: <A HREF="http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm">&lt;http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm&gt;</A>).  The GIS data projection is NAD83, UTM Zone 11N, however, for the KML/KMZ format the data is projected upon export to WGS84 Geographic, the native coordinate system used by Google Earth.  The data is within the area of interest of Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.

1.) GIS features were produced from source digital data.  See the Source Information Contribution section(s) for specific source map details.  GIS features were first imported into a GRI data model compliant geodatabase.  For details on the GRI data model see the NPS GRI Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 2.3 (available at: <A HREF="http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm">&lt;http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm&gt;</A>).  2.) Line quality was checked and if warranted edited to ensure good quality linework.  3.) Feature attribution was derived using the source data attribution, and the source printed/plotted map if available.  4.) Data Model topology rules were validated for all features and any topology errors corrected.  5.) Quality control (QC) consisted of checking features and their attribution against the source digital data, as well as against the source printed/plotted map if available.  A GRI developed ArcObjects tool was run to check for GRI data model validation and feature-related consistency.  6.) The UNIT and MAP tables were populated and checked against the source (s).  Relationship classes were also added and used to ensure attribution consistency between feature class and table attribution.  7.) Feature symbology was produced for all feature classes.  An attempt was made to best match symbology to its source map, however, in some cases features symbology maybe slightly modified, primarily based on the limitations of the ArcGIS geology style.  In some cases, however, symbology may have been modified to reconcile differences from multiple sources.  8.) GIS feature classes were exported from the geodatabase to shapefile (SHP) format, and GIS tables exported to DBASEIV (DBF) format.  Layer (LYR) files were also exported.  9.) The ancillary map information PDF document, see the Supplemental Information section for additional information, was produced from textual information and figures present on the source map(s) and/or in digital data files.  If applicable, source map images were produced at 150dpi or greater resolution and optical character recognition (OCR) software was used to produce text from source map text.  The text, source map images and other ancillary source map information were added to a Help &amp; Manual (HMXZ) template file.  The HMXZ file was then compiled to produce the ancillary map PDF document.  Any compilation errors were then checked and corrected and the document was reviewed for content, usability and grammatical errors.
